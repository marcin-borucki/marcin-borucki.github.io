I am Marcin. I live in Warsaw, Poland, in the esoteric district of [Praga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praga-P%C3%B3%C5%82noc). I have studied physics. Then I worked in banking in credit and market risk management. Currently, I am happily involved in data science stuff in much more tangible industrial data context. All of this was part fun, part challenge... definitely there were some lessons learned.

It's time to find new inspiration and growth for me. To write a blog seems to be a great way of doing it.

I will blog on [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) among other stuff.
* Doing things [*Agile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).
* Reading technical books...
* ...reviewing exercises therein.
* Reviewing available technologies.
* Working and talking with people about data stuff.
